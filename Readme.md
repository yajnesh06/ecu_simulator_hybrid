# ECU Simulator Hybrid (C + Python)

This project implements an ECU (Electronic Control Unit) simulator combining **C** and **Python** for efficient and modular design.  
The core ECU logic handling is implemented in C for performance, while the CAN bus communication is managed using Python with the `python-can` library.

## Features

- Implements core ECU service logic (e.g., responding to OBD-II PID requests) in C
- Uses Python for CAN bus interface with `python-can` library (`socketcan` backend)
- Hybrid architecture for modularity and performance optimization
- Logs CAN message processing and simulates realistic sensor values

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `python-can` library (`pip install python-can`)
- GCC (or compatible C compiler) for building the shared C library
- Linux environment with `socketcan` support and configured `can0` interface (or modify accordingly)

## Setup & Build Instructions

1. **Clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repo_url>
   cd ecu_simulator_hybrid
````

2. **Build the C shared library**

   ```bash
   make
   ```

   This will compile `ecu_logic.c` and produce `libecu.so` in the `ecu/` folder.

3. **Run the simulator**

   ```bash
   python3 main.py
   ```

   The script listens on `can0` interface, processes incoming CAN messages, and sends appropriate ECU responses.

## File Descriptions

* **ecu/ecu\_logic.c / ecu\_logic.h**
  Contains core ECU logic implemented in C, including PID response generation.

* **ecu\_wrapper.py**
  Python wrapper using `ctypes` to call the C functions.

* **main.py**
  Python script managing CAN communication, receiving messages, calling C logic, and sending responses.

* **Makefile**
  Automates building the C shared library.

---

## Notes

* Ensure `can0` interface is properly configured and enabled on your system.
* Modify `main.py` CAN interface settings if you use a different CAN backend or channel.
* This hybrid design allows easy extension by adding more ECU logic in C while keeping CAN communication in Python.
